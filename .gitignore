# PyTorch models and datasets
# CLIP models are typically downloaded to a cache directory by the 'clip' library.
# The default cache directory is usually ~/.cache/clip or similar.
# We explicitly ignore common model and dataset directories.
# If CLIP downloads models to a specific folder within your project, add it here.

# Common locations for downloaded models/checkpoints
models/
checkpoints/
data/
datasets/
weights/
runs/

# Specific CLIP cache directory (if it's inside your project, which is rare but possible)
# If your CLIP models are downloaded to a specific path within your project, add it here.
# Example: If you explicitly set a cache_dir for CLIP like:
# clip.load("ViT-B/32", device="cuda", download_root="./my_clip_cache/")
# then you would add:
# my_clip_cache/
